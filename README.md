Project Overview

This is a simple console-based application written in C that helps manage personal finances.
It was my first project, and the goal was to practice modular programming, file handling, and basic user interaction through a menu-driven interface.
The program allows users to log in, set a monthly budget, add expenses, track income, and view summaries of their spending. All data is saved to text files so it can be loaded back the next time the program runs.

Features

- User authentication with a basic login system
- Add, view, and remove expenses with date, category, description, and amount
- Set and update a monthly budget
- Add and track income
- Prevent adding expenses that exceed the budget
- View total and category-wise expense summaries
- Save and load expenses to and from text files
- Reset all data when needed

Technologies

- C programming language
- File handling in C for persistent storage
- Modular structure with multiple .c and .h files
